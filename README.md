## Words of introduction
Expert systems are an important aspect of creating a computer application with verified knowledge. Genius is supposed to be an application that, after introducing advanced knowledge of experts, allows other to use it.

## Technological foundations
The use of [microservices](https://microservices.io/) architecture allows us to create a system independent of the client application. Although the project presented here contains a sample web application based on [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core), thanks to the use of [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), we are able to offer almost any way to a client application, with the logic contained in the `Genius` microservice. The [stateless architecture](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/stateful-vs-stateless) has been chosen, which means that multiple people can use the system at the same time without affecting each other.

# Data
Data in the application is stored using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/). It is a fast and easy-to-configure database engine that does not require an additional server. However, with a large number of relations and if fuzzy logic will be introduced, the number of queries can be very large, then it's worth considering implementing a cache.

The database is not used directly. The structure was mapped to classes and objects using the [ORM (object-relational mapping)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping) mechanism. In the case of Genius, the [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/overview/first-app) was used.

# Client application
The sample client application found in the Genius.Client project uses React to present interface elements and perform queries. The queries from frontend are sent to the client server, which makes queries using gRPC to the main microservice, which contains the logic and the data of expert systems.

The lack of security on the side of the main microservice assumes that the client microservice verifies the permissions to perform queries with the use of some form of authorization.

# The logic of expert systems
## Conditional
Currently, a conditional mechanism for solving expert systems is implemented. It's looking for answers as long as there are no other questions to ask.

The method of asking questions is as follows:
1. Display the question
2. User replies: `Yes`, `No`, or `Don't know`
3. The system displays the next question or result

We assume that there may be many answers. Except for the responses themselves, we display the percentage of how many responses are the same as the result requirements.

# Editing
Ease of use was to be the basis of the client application. So we add our expert system and then its results. Each result has a number of conditions that belong to it.

# Getting started
To properly run Genius you need to have Visual Studio 2022 installed on your computer along with the web development tools and .NET 6. Besides, you should have Node and npm. Once downloaded and built, choose multiple startup projects - `Genius` and `Genius.Client`.

Then go to the page generated by the application.
