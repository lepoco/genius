## Words of introduction
Expert systems are an important aspect of creating a computer application with verified knowledge. Genius is supposed to be an application that, after introducing advanced knowledge of experts, allows other to use it.

## Technological foundations
The use of microservices architecture allows us to create a system independent of the client application. Although the project presented here contains a sample web application based on React and ASP.NET Core, thanks to the use of gRPC and Protocol Buffer, we are able to offer almost any way to a client application, with the logic contained in the Genius microservice.
